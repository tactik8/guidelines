# Code documentation guidelines
This document contains the guidelines to follow for documenting code

The code should follow Python PEP 8 style guide (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

## Version control
The code need to be stored in github under the repo provided. 

## Commenting
Each sections should be clearly documented as for the purpose and operations
Begin files with the following structure:
- Overview
- Inputs
- Outputs
- Tests values

# Stateless
Most functions will run in serverless environments (google functions, azure functions, etc.). 
The functions must thus be stateless and not rely on long-lived variables. 
Also, this means functions need to not exced 5-6 minutes of runtime. 


## Code complexity
Limit operations to one per line whenever possible to make it easier for others to follow

## External libraries
Limit libraries to well known, well maintained libraries.
