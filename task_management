# Task management
Tasks are listed as tickets in hubspot (hubspot.com)
Tickets are assigned to the developer 
When starting to work on a task, set the status of the ticket from "New" to "Open"
When assigned a task, the developer need to estimate the number of hours required to complete the task in the field 'Development estimate' 
The status is tracked using specific fields:
- Requirement complete
- Development complete
- Test complete
Communications / questions regarding a task should be done as 'Notes' within the ticket. This will ensure that all information regarding a task stays together.
